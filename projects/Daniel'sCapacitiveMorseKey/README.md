# YOUR PROJECT NAME

This is a PCB which will allow me to experiment using different designs for morse code keys. 
I made this because I have specific design requirements for my inteded use case (Portable amateur radio use).

*to fill in later*

A lot of datasheet reading, and finding components stocked by LCSC that would have the correct specs for this (mosfets switching at low voltages in sot23)
