# Capacitive Morse Code Paddle Key for POTA/SOTA

This is a PCB which will allow me to experiment using different designs for morse code keys. 
I made this because I have specific design requirements for my inteded use case (Portable low-power amateur radio use).

*to fill in price later*

A lot of datasheet reading, and finding components stocked by LCSC that would have the correct specs for this (mosfets switching at low voltages in sot23)
